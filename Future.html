	<h1 class="futurehouse"> My Future House</h1>
	<p class="futureplan">My plan is to finish my studies and then pursue my interest in architectural design in order to <br>improve my skills. I believe that if I choose what my preference or interest is, my career will be more<br> successful.
I will apply what I have learned outside of school to benefit the company or organization for<br> which I will work by being a good individual as well as a dependable and successful member<br> of the professional team.</p>
	<p class="scalemodel">This is the time we had a scale<br> model and it was the first time<br> we did this project so when we<br> finished it I was proud of myself<br> because I did such a good project.</p>
	<p class="commission">These are my commissions. I was studying Sketchup<br> and Vray Software to use them in the future.</p>
	<p class="houseplan">Then I started planning for my house. When we had<br> Immersion, I had the opportunity to do this,<br> and as a result, I finished the plan for my future house.</p>
