	<p class="para1">I started making beautiful memories when I was young.<br> I can't tell you everything, but the best experiences<br> I've had being with my family, friends,<br> and loved ones, and they have made<br> my memories happy.</p>
	<p class="para2">This is one of the best memories I can say<br> because I have proved that it is good to study<br> especially if we have friends to be with<br> so that together we can reach our goal of graduating<br> and getting a diploma. We will face all the challenges<br> and we will go up together.</p>
	<p class="para3">This is a special happy memory for me.<br> We got our driver's licenses for the first time last year,<br> and I was with my girlfriend. It was a memorable<br> experience that I will never forget. And here I have<br> proved that the one who truly loves is the one who will<br> accompany you to what you want to happen while also<br> accomplishing your dreams. Because love doesn't need<br> to be perfect. It just has to be  true.</p>
